## Back-End : PaaS
By the absence of the explicit requirement about to _create any kind of Back-End_. It was assumed that the persistence of data in this project wouldn't be via MERN (not Nodejs &Expressjs). 

So, It's used MongoDB services like Realm to work with in a _Platform as a Service_ way or _Serverless_ kind of app, because no specification is defined.
